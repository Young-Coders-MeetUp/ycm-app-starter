This app's main feature is to translate sign words into written English. It was entered by the Young Coder's Meetup (known as the YCM) as part of the [Nesta Longitude Explorer Prize](https://longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/im-a-longitude-explorer-finalist/). The aim is to enable young Deaf learners to improve their literacy skills. Here is the corresponding [website](https://youngcodersmeetup3.wixsite.com/website) for the project. 

To get the app running, first make sure you have Expo installed. Follow these [instructions](https://expo.io/learn) to get it installed. If you don't have the Expo client installed on your phone, make sure you have it now.

Download the code from this [Github repostitory](https://github.com/Young-Coders-MeetUp/ycm-sign2word-app).

Next, in your terminal, run `npm install`. 

After that has finished, run `Expo start`. 

This will bring the Expo tools on the browser up, along with a QR code. Then, on your phone, scan the QR code and open the app.
